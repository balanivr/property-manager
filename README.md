This project has been created as a demonstration of the building blocks for a property management system (designed like a CMS). Please note that, while this is a part of a real project, all propietary code has been removed and what remains is a base to build upon. Follow the instructions below to continue deevelopment.

## Configuration

This project has been built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The dependencies that this project depends on include:
- [Firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)
- [Firestore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@firebase/firestore)
- [Material-UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-ui)
- [Material-UI Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-ui)

In order to run the project, you must first run the following command:

### `npm install`

This installs all components listed in `package.json`.

Following this, you must place your configuration details from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) in `src\config.js`.<br>
For more details, please follow [these steps form the documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

## Running the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

If you're hesitant about coding, remember: Coding is an art, not a science. The goal is the plot, the variables are the characters and you are God, writing their story. Make a pull request and break the code if you have to in order to understand why it was there in the first place. Everyone, even Gods, start somewhere.
